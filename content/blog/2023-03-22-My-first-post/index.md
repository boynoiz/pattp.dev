## Start blogging again...

It's been a long time since I blog my thing, Last time I do it was with Wordpress.com.

Now, let's try something new. After looking for a blogging tool I found [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) the static site engine.

Then after trying to understand how it works include using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) as the CSS Framework, I found the [Izy](https://github.com/VV0JC13CH/izy-zola) theme that create by [Wojciech](https://github.com/VV0JC13CH) and I hope that he don't mind if I try to learn Zola and Tailwind from his theme (Thank you so much)
