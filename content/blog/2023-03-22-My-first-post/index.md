## Back to Blogging

It's been a long time since I've actively blogged. Last time, I used Wordpress.com.

Now, let's try something new! After researching blogging tools, I found [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a static site generator.

After experimenting with Zola and incorporating [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) as my CSS framework, I discovered the [Izy](https://github.com/VV0JC13CH/izy-zola) theme created by [Wojciech](https://github.com/VV0JC13CH])  I hope he doesn't mind me using his theme as a learning resource for Zola and Tailwind. (Thank you so much!)
