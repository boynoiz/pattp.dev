Hey! I'm Patt, a DevOps Engineer and Part-time programmer living and working in Bangkok, Thailand. Welcome to my little space on the internet. This website is for my projects, tutorials, travel, and memo things from my daily adventure.

### What I'm doing now
- I'm working as a Senior DevOps Engineer at [Sellsuki](https://www.sellsuki.co.th/)
- Learning Rust
- Building Kubernetes cluster with 4 Raspberry Pi as my home lab, Looking forward to using [Compute Blade](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/uptimelab/compute-blade) with Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4

### Facts about me
- When I was 16 years old, I spent my time after school at an internet cafe to learn HTML, upload the website with FTP to Yahoo GeoCities, and get paid for ads banners
- I worked at an internet cafe, learned how to fix the computer, set up the local network, LAMP stack, and web programming with PHP and JavaScript.
- Started opening the computer shop, but it's not going well
- I worked as a Graphic Designer before, Started a printing shop, then converted myself to Web Developer, then DevOps Engineer.
- I love camping in the countryside or hiking the national park mountains. I hope to challenge the [Mount Mokoju](https://thailandtourismdirectory.go.th/en/attraction/2288) before I get old. LOL
- Since we started working from home in 2020, I can feel my legs are too weak made me decide to begin running and then join running events.
