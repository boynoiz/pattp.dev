Hello! I'm Patt, a DevOps Engineer and part-time programmer based in Bangkok, Thailand. Welcome to my corner of the internet, where I share my projects, tutorials, travel adventures, and notes from my journey.

**What I'm Doing Now:**

* Working as a Senior Site Reliability Engineer at [Sellsuki](https://www.sellsuki.co.th/).
* Exploring the Go programming language.
* Building a home lab Kubernetes cluster with four Raspberry Pis, including setting up NAS for persistent storage.

**Facts About Me:**

* I started my tech journey at 16, learning HTML in internet cafes and creating websites with GeoCities (earning money from ad banners!).
* I've worked at an internet cafe (fixing computers, building networks, and learning LAMP stack web development).
* My entrepreneurial ventures include a computer shop and a printing business.
* My career path has evolved: Graphic Designer → Web Developer → DevOps Engineer/Site Reliability Engineer.
* I'm an outdoor enthusiast – camping, hiking, and I dream of climbing Mount Mokoju!
* The 2020 work-from-home shift inspired me to focus on fitness through running events.
* Badminton is another passion of mine.

**Programming Languages:**

* Go, PHP, JavaScript, Bash, Python, Terraform HCL
